Revision history for Perl extension Module::Build::Convert.

0.21_02 Tue Nov 15 12:29:09 CET 2005
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker arguments 'DISTNAME', 'ABSTRACT', 'AUTHOR', 
   'VERSION' and 'VERSION_FROM' are excluded from default conversion 
   as the Module::Build argument 'module_name' doesn't require 
   their Module::Build equivalents per se.
 - Likewise the disabling for 'build_requires', 'recommends' and 
   'conflicts' which are default arguments.

0.21_01 Thu Nov  3 21:54:29 CET 2005
 - Made _compose_header() more consistent in adding newlines
   in an adequate manner.

0.21 Tue Nov  1 21:42:10 CET 2005
 - Moved the package Make::Build::Convert to the namespace 
   Module::Build to disambiguate its uses.

0.20_07 Sun Oct 30 18:10:09 CET 2005
 - To avoid that global scalars are "polluted" by running 
   "do 'Makefile.PL'", they're copied by _save_globals() and 
   restored by _restore_globals().

0.20_05 Thu Oct 27 20:36:47 CEST 2005
 - Polished some of the parsing code up to the extent that
   it is able to recognize and process standalone comments properly.
 - A trailing comment of a MakeMaker argument entry is appended
   to the Module::Build equivalent for all type variants.
 - Some unnecessary newlines are removed while composing
   the header of a Build.PL. 

0.20_04 Sun Oct 23 14:51:30 CEST 2005
 - _compose_header() rearranges the placement of the shebang,
   line, comments, use/require statements should they appear
   within the Makefile.PL in order to fit in nicely with the 
   default Build.PL code. The use/require ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   statement will be removed as it becomes unneeded.

0.20_03 2005/10/21
 - Statically parsing the Makefile.PL as the method to
   "receive" MakeMaker arguments, supersedes the previous 
   known "do 'Makefile.PL'" evaluation.
 - _parse_args() has been added that acts as de-facto 
   replacement of _run_makefile() . Scalar, array and hash
   arguments will be extracted by parsing the Makefile
   string; code chunks are processed in a separate branch.
 - A warning is emitted if WriteMakefile() takes indirect
   arguments via a hash.

0.20_02 2005/10/18
 - The necessary subs to write and parse the contents of a 
   RC-file have been added.
 - Further MakeMaker arguments to be converted includes
   the Module::Build equivalents: PL_files, pm_files, 
   pod_files, xs_files, include_dirs, meta_add.
 - Usage and version output in make2build is being embedded 
   to subs.
 - The unintentional space preceeding filenames in MANIFEST
   issue has been resolved.

0.20 2005/10/15
 - Conversion from script to object-oriented module.

0.19 2005/10/13
 - The obligatory usage screen and according switches have 
   been introduced.
 - The verbosity output has been extended to mention the 
   overriding of arguments and arguments that are classified 
   as unknown to the user while conversion is in charge.
 - sort_args() is able to distinguish whether the native
   sorting order should be preserved or the default one
   used instead.
 - do_verbose() outputs based on verbosity levels.

0.18_02 2005/10/12
 - Test failures have been fixed.
 - The code chunk that cleaned args of unneeded whitespace
   has been replaced with a ?{} construct.
 - Commas are added to enclosing brackets.

0.18 2005/09/28
 - The conversion & interpretation of arguments which 
   specify temporary files for removement has been implemented. 
   [ Nathan Gray <kolibrie@graystudios.org> ]
 - Array argument conversion has been integrated with included
   string to elements conversion, when necessary. 

0.17 2005/03/07
 - Added recommends, build_requires, conflicts, pm_files,
   extra_compiler_flags, sign, dist_abstract, dist_author
   to conversion table.

0.16 2005/03/06
 - A notice is placed in the created Build.PL, indicating
   that it was created by make2build.

0.12 2004/02/23
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker arguments DISTNAME, VERSION, VERSION_FROM, 
   are converted and output sorted.
 - Default value of the license argument has been replaced 
   with 'unknown'.

0.11 2004/02/22
 - Documentation has been largely extended.

0.07 2004/02/19
 - Redundant, unneeded code removed.

0.01 2004/02/09
 - Initial version.
